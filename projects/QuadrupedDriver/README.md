# Quadruped Servo Driver

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board is an upgrade to my last years WHW project https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/Scott170 (scroll down). It will use an arduion nano to control 12 servos (3 on each leg). The goal is for it to be lightweight making a pcb way better than a breadboard

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

58 dollary doos (ruh roh)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
While designing, I was unfamiliar with a lot of components that I wanted/needed to use. I got a lot of help on slack (thanks yall!)
